Welcome
Bash scripts that I've written over the years, this is a repository for several projects that I've created with linux bash mostly for IT.

Wicked Cool Shell Scripts, 2nd Edition, 101 Scripts for Linux, OS X, and UNIX Systems

The scripts in the folder WickedShellScriptsbook are originally described in the book Wicked Cool Shell Scripts, 2nd Edition, 101 Scripts for Linux, OS X, and UNIX Systems By Dave Taylor and Brandon Perry, which I highly recommend, I just wrote those that I found more useful in my professional experience, for all the scripts in the book (and better written) please visit/clone the Brandon Perry's repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/brandonprry/wicked_cool_shell_scripts_2e.git

Thanks!
